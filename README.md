## What is seer?
**seer** is a virtual intelligence that can predict the outcome of a 5v5 League of Legends match simply by looking at the
past statistics of each player in the game, despite Riot Games' best effort to evenly match players.

## How it works
**seer** makes its decisions based on a neural network that is trained by a genetic algorithm, a type of evolutionary algorithm.
